        <p class="about-paragraph">
          Hi, I'm <strong>Reza Darooei</strong> â€” an <strong>FCS Postdoctoral Research Fellow</strong> in Software Engineering at the <strong>University of Bern</strong>, supported by the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship. I hold a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering, specializing in <em>OCT cyst segmentation using deep learning and sparse representation</em>.
          <br><br>
          My research focuses on developing <strong>VR-based blended learning solutions</strong> to improve physician-patient communication, especially in managing frightened children during critical care. I believe technology, empathy, and rigorous science together can transform healthcare.
          <br><br>
          Previously, I worked as a <strong>Regulatory Affairs Specialist</strong> at Iran FDA, ensuring medical devices and AI systems met stringent safety standards. I am passionate about <strong>startups and freelancing</strong>, providing early-stage ventures with prototypes, business models, and market research strategies.
          <br><br>
          My technical expertise spans <strong>Python, MATLAB, C++, C#, JavaScript, Unreal Engine, Unity</strong>, and game development tools like <strong>Daz3D, iClone, and Maya</strong>. Whether developing AI models, immersive VR training, or therapeutic games, I strive to create impactful, human-centered solutions.
