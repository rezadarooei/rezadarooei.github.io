              Hello! I'm <strong>Reza Darooei</strong>, currently an <strong>FCS Postdoctoral Research Fellow</strong> in Software Engineering at the <strong>University of Bern</strong>, supported by the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship. I hold a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, where I specialized in <em>OCT cyst segmentation using deep learning and sparse basis methods</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              My research focuses on developing <strong>VR-based blended learning solutions</strong> to enhance physician-patient communication, particularly in managing distress among pediatric patients. By creating immersive training environments, I aim to bridge gaps in traditional medical education and improve clinical care outcomes.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              Previously, I worked as a <strong>Regulatory Affairs Specialist</strong> at the Iran Food and Drug Administration, overseeing compliance for medical devices and AI systems. Alongside my academic career, I am passionate about <strong>startups and freelancing</strong>, providing early-stage ventures with technological and business development support, including prototype design, market analysis, and strategic planning.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              My technical toolkit spans <strong>Python, MATLAB, C++, C#, JavaScript, Unreal Engine, Unity,</strong> and advanced game development tools like Daz3D, iClone, and Maya, enabling me to build interactive, research-driven experiences at the intersection of healthcare, AI, and immersive technology.
            </p>
